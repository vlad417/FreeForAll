What was easy about this assignment?

	Understanding the principles of the Freanzy game and implementing piece
	action/intelligence.


What gave you problems/troubles?

	We had difficulty properly implementing complex interaction between multiple
	asynchronous game piece threads, the controllers, and the UI. There were
	issues with starvation that we had to address. We also had issues with the
	board not properly updating because of non-synchronized calls to modify the
	game model.


What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?

	We don't know, over all we both thought the assignment had a good amount of
	work involved, and was a good lesson in Android thread interaction.


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

	It would have been interesting to implement some sort of multi-user handling
	where mulitple mobile devices could connect to a server a join the game,
	each device being represented by a different player.
